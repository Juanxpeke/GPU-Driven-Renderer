# OpenGL Tests

The projects within this folder serve as a way to learn how to use the methods provided by OpenGL 4.6.

## Compute Shaders

Compute shaders are a general purpose way of parallel programming using the GPU, just as CUDA or OpenCL kernels.

### Raycast

This program uses compute shaders to continously write data on a texture that is shown on the sreen, simulating an orthogonal raycast to a sphere. It is a modified and simpler version of the code presented in [An Introduction to Compute Shaders](https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/compute.html) by Anton Gendelan.
