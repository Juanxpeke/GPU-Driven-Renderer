# Learning
  - Study Cell engine
  - Study Vulkan guide

# Renderer
  - Improve path managers to remove .string() and support multiple renderers

# Debugging
  - Solve useless pointer returned by Renderer create methods (std::vector modification causes change of pointers)
  - Solve rotation logic (Ex: Camera rotation should be around global Y axis but its around local one)

# Misc
  - Remove repeated assimp in CMakeLists
  - See "casual" way of setting sampler2D uniform without glUniform1i
  - Use CMake instruction for project organization (in specific separate glad from the solution main projects)
  - Add Lotus namespace
  - Add ImGUI for changing values in runtime
